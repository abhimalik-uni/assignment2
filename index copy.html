            Victoria, located in the southeastern region of Australia, is distinguished as the home to Melbourne,
             acclaimed as the "World's Most Livable City." In line with its prestigious title, the real estate market
              in Victoria, especially in Melbourne, experienced a significant rise in demand and competitive pricing 
              throughout 2016 and 2017, fueled by the city's widespread desirability. This surge in demand led to a 
              prolific increase in property development, presenting a fusion of modern and heritage offerings in the 
              market.

          <p> The average number of properties sold per suburb across 2016 and 2017 was 43 properties. The sales
            score represents a standardised score ranging from -1 to 1 which is scaled based on a ratio of the number of properties sold and the total number of properties
            in that suburb. The average sales score is represented by 0 whilst suburbs that performed below this average are negative and positive for above
            the average.

          <p>Almost all suburbs with a positive sales score were within a 15.5 kilometre radius from the city centre. The hottest suburbs with sales scores
            of 1 were the neighbouring suburbs of Essendon West and Niddrie in Melbourne's North-West. </p>

          <p> There were over 13,000 properties sold in 2016 and 2017 which were sold by 268 different real estate agencies and agents. The five well established 
            agencies Barry Plant, Hockingstuart, Jellis Craig, Nelson Alexander and Ray White sold just over 42% of the properties in 2016 and 2017. The 5,706 properties sold
           by these five real estate agencies had a collective value of over 6 billion AUD. The remaining 58% of properties were sold by 263 various real
            estate agencies and individual agents.

            <p>Of the three property types, Houses were the most common
            property type and had the highest
          median prices followed by Townhouses and lastly, Units. On the contrary, Units maintained their median prices the further they were from the city centre
        whilst Houses and Townhouses exhbitied a steeper decline. For all property types, the proximity to the city centre served as a strong factor in median prices. </p>

          <p>The steep linear relationship between the distance from the city centre and the properties' build year shows the 
            fast paced expansion of Victoria's capital, Melbourne. As of 2023, Melbourne is Australia's most populous city with a population of over 5 million people.
            There is a notable spike in Townhouses after 1990, highlighting the scarcity of land and increase in population, resulting in a surge in Townhouse building. The older properties
            had higher prices as they were located much closer to the city centre.

        <div class="description description-right">
          <p> Property prices are very complex and are influenced by many factors. 
            The strongest influencers for property price were the building and land size (square metres),
            distance from city centre (kilometres) and number of bedrooms. There was an increase in building and land sizes 
            the further the property was from the city centre as land was more accessible. There was also a trend of smaller building
            and land sizes with less bedrooms in all distances from the city, depicting the practicality of properties.

          <p>The median purchase price across all properties was 903,000 AUD. Kooyong boasted the highest suburb median
            price of 2,185,000 AUD. There is a strong correlation between the median prices of the suburbs and its
            location relative to the Yarra river, Central Business District and the coast. Most of the suburbs with the
            highest median prices were located below the Yarra river, closer to the CBD and also along the shoreline. </p>
            <p>The majority of the properties were sold in the winter season (June, July and August) and the least were sold in the summer season
              (December, January and February). However, the number of sales were inversely proportional to the median price of the properties sold
            in that season. The summer season had a median property price of 957,500 AUD, almost 11% greater than winter's median price.  </p>

          <p>As previously discovered, the winter months had the highest number of sales whilst the market was much slower 
            in the festive months (December - February). The Northern Metropolitan and Southern Metropolitan regions were the largest
          contributers to Victoria's sales. The South-Eastern Metropolitan and Regional Victoria (Northern, Eastern and Western Victoria) 
        contained the least number of properties and this was reflected in their monthly sales. Regional Victoria had by far the least number of sales
      showing the influence and demand for city proximity by Victorians.    </p>
