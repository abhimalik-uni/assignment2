            Victoria, located in the southeastern region of Australia, is distinguished as the home to Melbourne,
             acclaimed as the <b>"World's Most Livable City"</b>. In line with its prestigious title, the real estate market
              in Victoria, especially in Melbourne, experienced a significant rise in demand and competitive pricing 
              throughout 2016 and 2017, fueled by the city's widespread desirability. This surge in demand led to a 
              prolific increase in property development, presenting a fusion of modern and heritage offerings in the 
              market.

          <p> The average number of properties sold per suburb across 2016 and 2017 was <b>43</b> properties. The sales
            score represents a standardised score ranging from -1 to 1 which is scaled based on a ratio of the number of properties sold and the total number of properties
            in that suburb. The average sales score is represented by 0 whilst suburbs that performed below this average are negative and positive for above
            the average.

          <p>Almost all suburbs with a positive sales score were within a <b>15.5 kilometre radius</b> from the city centre. The hottest suburbs with sales scores
            of <b>1</b> were the neighbouring suburbs of Essendon West and Niddrie in Melbourne's North-West. </p>

          <p> There were over <b>13,00</b> properties sold in 2016 and 2017 which were sold by <b>268 different</b> real estate agencies and agents. The five well established 
            agencies <span class='barry_text'>Barry Plant</span>, <span class='hocking_text'>Hockingstuart</span>, <span class='jellis_text'>Jellis Craig</span>, <span class='nelson_text'>Nelson Alexander</span> and <span class='ray_text'>Ray White</span> sold just over 42% of the properties in 2016 and 2017. The 5,706 properties sold
           by these five real estate agencies had a collective value of over <b>6 billion AUD</b>. The remaining 58% of properties were sold by 263 various real
            estate agencies and individual agents.
            </p>

            <p> More than <b>90%</b> of properties were sold on a Saturday which consistently proved to be a strong day for real estate proved by both real estate agents and avid buyers in Victoria.
              Real estate agents strategically schedule property inspections, open houses, and auctions on Saturdays to maximise attendance 
              and create a competitive bidding atmosphere.

Of the three property types, <span class='house_text'>Houses</span> were the most common property type and had the highest median prices 
followed by <span class='townhouse_text'>Townhouses</span> and lastly, <span class='unit_text'>Units</span>. On the contrary, <span class='unit_text'>Units</span> maintained their median prices the 
further they were from the city centre, benefiting from a more stable pricing trend. 
<span class='house_text'>Houses</span> and <span class='townhouse_text'>Townhouses</span>, on the other hand, exhibited a steeper decline in median prices as the distance 
from the city centre increased. This discrepancy can be attributed to various factors, including lifestyle 
preferences, land availability, and demand for housing in different areas.</p>
<p>
The proximity to the city centre undeniably served as a strong factor in determining median prices for all property types. 
The city centre typically offers a plethora of amenities, better employment opportunities, and convenient access to transportation hubs. 
These advantages make properties located nearby more attractive to buyers and renters, resulting in higher demand and subsequently elevated property prices.

          <p>The steep linear relationship between the distance from the city centre and the properties' build year shows the 
            fast paced expansion of Victoria's capital, Melbourne. As of 2023, Melbourne is Australia's most populous city with a population of over <b>5 million</b> people.
            There is a notable spike in <span class='townhouse_text'>Townhouses</span> after 1990, highlighting the scarcity of land and increase in population, resulting in a surge in <span class='townhouse_text'>Townhouse</span> building. The older properties
            had higher prices as they were located much closer to the city centre.

          <p> Property prices are very complex and are influenced by many factors. 
            The strongest influencers for property price were the building and land size (square metres),
            distance from city centre (kilometres) and number of bedrooms. There was an increase in building and land sizes 
            the further the property was from the city centre as land was more accessible. There was also a trend of smaller building
            and land sizes with less bedrooms in all distances from the city, depicting the practicality of properties.

          <p>The median purchase price across all properties was <b>903,000 AUD</b>. Kooyong boasted the highest suburb median
            price of <b>2,185,000 AUD</b>. There is a strong correlation between the median prices of the suburbs and its
            location relative to the Yarra river, city centre and the shoreline along Port Phillip Bay. Most of the suburbs with the
            highest median prices were located below the Yarra river, closer to the CBD and also along the shoreline. </p>
            <p>The majority of the properties were sold in the winter season (June, July and August) and the least were sold in the summer season
              (December, January and February). However, the number of sales were inversely proportional to the median price of the properties sold
            in that season. The summer season had a median property price of <b>957,500 AUD</b>, almost <b>11%</b> greater than winter's median price.  </p>

            <p>This might indicate that the buyers who do participate during the summer season are willing to pay a premium for their desired properties, 
              perhaps due to the perceived value of moving during the warmer months or being settled in a new home before the start of the school year.</p>

          <p>As previously discovered, the winter months had the highest number of sales whilst the market was much slower 
            in the festive months (December - February). The <span class='hocking_text'>Northern Metropolitan</span> and <span class='s_metro'>Southern Metropolitan</span> regions were the largest
          contributers to Victoria's sales. The <span class='se_metro'>South-Eastern Metropolitan</span> and <span class='regional'>Regional Victoria (Northern, Eastern and Western Victoria)</span> 
        contained the least number of properties and this was reflected in their monthly sales. <span class='regional'>Regional Victoria</span> had by far the least number of sales
      showing the influence and demand for city proximity by Victorians.    </p>


      <p><span class='regional'>Regional Victoria</span>, distinctly differs in terms of demand and sales volume.
        While these areas may appeal to those seeking a quieter, more suburban or rural lifestyle, the lower sales indicate a preference for the 
        amenities, employment prospects, and social activities available in closer proximity to the city.</p>

        <p>Understanding these geographical variations in the real estate market is pivotal for both buyers and sellers. 
          It sheds light on the diverse preferences and priorities of Victorians, enabling a more informed approach when it comes 
          to buying or selling property. </p>
